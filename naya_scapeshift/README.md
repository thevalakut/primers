# NahiriShift Primer January 2019

By Xavier Elisseeff

**Introduction**

	What is Valakut and why am I even reading this?
Dear Timmy, if you are reading this primer you might already be in love with the Molten Pinnacle or may be trying to understand why so many people find it so hot. The beating heart of our beloved deck is [[Valakut, The molten Pinnacle]] and it’s whole architecture revolves around exploiting it (in a consensual way, as you should always do). Valakut is what we call a big mana deck, and as Timmys, we are not the kind of people interested in playing small spells that won’t have much of an impact. Anything with a converted mana cost of three and less is a tool for us. We like big stuff; there is nothing more satisfying than casting a [[Bloodbraid Elf]] on turn three then a [[Primeval Titan]] turn four while looking at the desperate face of your opponent. 
If you don’t know it already, the idea behind Valakut decks is to ramp early so you can cast your finishers sooner. By using [[Search for tomorrow]] or [[Farseek]] you can reach 6 or 7 lands by Turn 4, allowing you to cast [[Primeval Titan]]. When you cast Primeval Titan, you fetch more lands, dealing lots of damage if you control an active Valakut. Casting PrimeTime can threatening lethal the following turn with a Titanic attack. If you have 7 or more lands, you can cast [[Scapeshift]] and deal 18+ damage (more detail about how Scapeshift works later).

	Why Naya? Bloodbraid Elf and Nahiri: the Love Story.

When Bloodbraid Elf was unbanned in February 2018, I knew Valakut could be a good shell for it. For few months, I tried to force it into a classic R/G Valakut list but it never worked. I was able to cast Bloodbraid Elf on turn three consistently, which is great, but the value out of cascade was not reaching my expectations. I was either super happy so to see ramp spells like [[Farseek]] allowing me to cast a [[Primeval Titan]] turn four, or very disappointed to see [[Summoner’s Pact]] or [[Khalni Heart Expedition]]. I knew something was wrong but I couldn’t put my finger on it yet.

As a Biologist, and a fanboy of Charles Darwin, I feel like playing Naya is all about the necessary adaptation to our environment. As the metagame evolves, we need to evolve alongside it to survive everything new the format can throw at us. By adding white to our deck, we are evolving to make sure we can keep up with the fancy graveyard and artifact decks of the meta. Adding a new color to the deck is like learning a new language; it opens so many new options. From the mainboard to the sideboard, I tried to rethink the deck in a way that would try to compensate the flaws our deck might have, while still advancing our primary gameplan. After looking at many other decklists, I realised: I can have a great turn three with Bloodbraid Elf, why not make every turn three great? I knew from the start that splashing a color in a deck with that many fetch lands and ramp spells wouldn’t be difficult so I tweaked a bit the manabase to play Nahiri. From the start she seems promising: card selection, removal and an ultimate that wins me the game! To make some room for Nahiri, I got rid of the bad cascading cards and tried to focus only on Bloodbraid Elf and her, keeping in mind that they are tools for our big guns: [[Primeval Titan]] and [[Scapeshift]]. To make sure I’m not missing anything, I’ll list below why I think they are strong. They both must be answered, or they will win the game alone. They are drawing a lot of attention away from our life total and that gives us lot of time to find the right answer/win condition. Also, they keep the deck consistent while adding a new gameplan.


*Bloodbraid Elf (BBE) - Cascading to victory*

BBE will allow you to have a board presence early that will require an answer. An unrespected BBE can deal a lot of damage and bring our opponent in range of just few bolts or Valakut triggers. In aggro matchups, BBE can allow you to create a board presence to block while still ramping (especially if you find Sakura-Tribe Elder). Cascading into a ramp spell turn three will still allow you to cast Primeval Titan or Scapeshift turn four, while dealing the 3 damage necessary to bring them in range for a 7 land Scapeshift.
In post-sideboard games, BBE will dig for the cards we side in, as all of our payoff cards cost 4 or more and all the sideboard 3 or less. BBE wont flip anything that is not ramp (reaching late game faster), or sideboard (hating your opponent/interacting). 
BBE is definitely a great card but it requires a real deck building restriction to make it work . I believe it’s a mistake to play it with Summoner’s pact and other non relevant cascade effects.

*Nahiri, The Harbinger (Nahiri) - Her pluses and minuses*

+2: In a deck like ours, we lack card selection, she can put in a lot of work on sculpting your hand on matchups without clock. Getting rid of useless ramp spells in control matchups to find multiples copies of Scapeshift is extremely strong. Note that while we are plussing, we are also getting closer the the ultimate, forcing them again to have an answer.

-2: She can naturally deal with hate by removing problematic enchantments like Blood Moon, Alpine Moon, Leyline of Sanctity, Search for Azcanta, etc. You don’t need to pack your enchantment hate every game, especially if you are unsure if you even need enchantment removal. Nahiri does a great job of incidentally being enchantment removal while not being entirely dead if they didn’t board in any valid targets. Because we play BBE and we want to cascade into relevant spells all the time, we are not playing [[Path to Exile]] but don’t worry, she will take care of that part too if necessary. You also give even more value to late game Sakura-Tribe Elder, as they will need to think twice before attacking.

-8: If not answered while cast on turn three, she will be able to ultimate by turn 5 for a Primeval Titan and close the game. Same as in the breach version of the deck, any Titan that attacks usually means the game is over.


	What is the difference between this and the classic R/G Scapeshift?

In the Naya version, cards like Nahiri and BBE have a higher floor, but of course in some situations a lower ceiling too. Think about KHE vs Nahiri - Nothing beats the ramping of a turn two KHE, allowing you some ridiculous number of lands turn 4 for an easy lethal Scapeshift. But, you will feel the pain of topdecking a KHE on turn 4 when you need action. Nahiri can bring a little bit of everything; she can have the same explosive nature as the KHE, ultimating turn 5 (slower than KHE, of course) and can single handedly win the game. But, compared to KHE, she will always be a decent topdeck later with multiple options. You can also think about Explore - the draw and the extra land drop are great, if you can make it. But in some ways I think that’s what BBE is doing when she flips Farseek and deal 3 damage, assuming I would have draw bolt from explore for example. So overall we are doing the same things, just not the same ways. As I increased the average CMC of the Naya version, even if it might sometimes slow it a bit, it increase my options and my potential plays according to the situation’s need. We also increased the total number of threats in the deck, which is something that bothered me sometimes. I don’t like waiting for one of the 10 win condition and just lose if I can’t find one of them.

	What about the Sideboard then?

As always, modern has been a meta of sideboard and I feel like you only have two real options to have a successful sideboard strategy: 1) To be as linear and non interactive as possible. Build your sideboard to stick to you main game plan and dodge the hate/side of your opponent. -> What RG is doing right now. 2) Build a deck that’s flexible enough to adapt to most situations -> What Naya is starting to do. Both options are fine, the second one just fits my play style better.

Ever since I knew I would like to exploit BBE as much as possible, I tried to build the mainboard and the sideboard in a way that would make her even stronger. As you guessed already, we will be mostly looking at cards with a CMC of 3 or less. Also, we can go even deeper in that strategy by shaving some number ramp or interaction spells. Thus, increasing the odds of finding our sideboard and the sideboard efficiency. 

More details about the sideboard in the dedicated section below.

It is also important to know who you will be playing against and what you are preparing for. If you are a kitchen table player and know you will be playing your friend on Burn, Tron and UW Control, you might want to adapt your sideboard accordingly. I like to have a look at MTG top 8 to see what the big picture is and adapt my sideboard for my next big event. Note also that it’s important to know yourself as a player and try to understand the most optimal way of playing for you. I know for a fact that I won’t be a good Bring to Light player because it’s not the kind of things I like to do, I’m way too proactive as a player to keep a Cryptic or a Remand in my hand. The right play won’t always appear to me as naturally because it doesn’t match my usual thought process.

I would like to finish this introduction by saying that evolution is a perpetual process that drives all brewers to make something new or better. So please, brew as much as you can, let the Johnny in you express him/herself as much as possible! If you find a new innovation, specially about NayaShift, please let us know!

	Maindeck

Before this version of Naya, people either just splashed for the sideboard(which is a great choice if you like the regular Rg but still want the sideboard options), or they played [[Renegade Rallier]]. In my opinion, the card is really bad in our deck: as we can’t reliably trigger revolt on command with only 7 lands and 4 Sakura, we are missing the only reason we are playing the card. In some ways BBE is the better version of Rallier as you will always have something to cast with it, and if you build the deck properly, good things. Because of the curve, as we are trying to have 4 Mana on turn 3, it doesn’t change anything to have a Rallier or BBE. If you don’t know it already, Sakura and Fetches are extremely important late game as they can be instant speed, uncounterable lightning bolts, one more reason why you don’t want to just sac it at sorcery speed to maybe have it back if Rallier resolve the same turn.

Except the interaction pieces I don’t think this deck has a lot of flex slots to toy with:

* Lands (27) - The manabase is pretty set but I could see some update to adapt to the meta. Shaving one Sacred Foundry or one Valakut might be an option to either play one more card or have an extra copy of another land. We can do it in some matchups.
* Ramping (12) - Sakura, Search, and Farseek. I never cut any Sakura or Search but game two and three as I’m expecting the game to be longer I cut up to two Farseek to make some room for interaction.
* Interaction (6) - Lightning bolt and Lightning helix. These one are 100% meta dependant so pick the best for your meta. Note that it’s a real plus if you can keep the cascade always relevant: Slagstorm is a good example as it can be cast to wipe the board vs creatures matchups and it can be cast face vs creatureless decks. Bonus points vs UW - it kills Geist.
* Win condition (15) - BBE, Titan, Nahiri, and Scapeshift. All of these cards will stay in most everytime you go to board. The only exception to this is BBE. BBE can be shaved in some MUs.

*Maybeboard (Mainboard and Sideboard) - To be update as my testing goes*

Even if we are primarily looking at spells that will be below 3 CMC, it is sometimes worth it to find some amazing sideboard card that will crush our opponent anyway. We will be looking at the power level of Crumble to Dust in the mirror or vs Tron for example. Card with a CMC of 4 are still really interesting as we might be able to play them on turn three consistently.

Creatures

* Emrakul, the Aeons Torn - in most matchups if you can ultimate Nahiri for Titan, it’s a win already. Emy just feels likes a winmore card and is a super bad topdeck overall.
* Carnage Tyrant - To be tested
* Chameleon Colossus - To be tested, still great in a Deathshadow meta.
* Courser of Kruphix - To be tested, I’m not expecting much of it, unless we are playing a super aggro meta.
* Huntmaster of the Fells - To be tested
* Obstinate Baloth - Amazing vs Liliana of the Veil, but I’m trying Knight of Autumn at the moment. Less powerful but more polyvalent.
* Pia and Kiran Nalaar - To be tested
* Ruric Thar, the Unbowed - To be tested
* Scab-Clan Berserker - To be tested, I’m waiting for storm to come back.
* Vexing Shusher - Our control matchup is so good I can’t see why this would need to be there.

Planeswalkers

* Chandra, Torch of Defiance - Would fight with Nahiri’s slot. Probably more relevant in the RG version.

Enchantments

* Leyline of Sanctity - To be tested
* Racking Canopy - To be tested
* Seal of Primordium - To be tested

Artifacts

* Chalice of the void - To be tested, not great with BBE but can be incredibly powerful in the right matchup.

Instant and Sorcery

* Crumble to Dust - Plays well in our turn three with four mana. Can be play in a land based metagame like Tron/Valakut.
* Explore - seems to be insanely good with BBE, the only problem is the mana fixing of a 3 color deck. We need Farseek to make sure we don’t have any colored mana problem.
* Faithless Looting - To be tested
* Hour of Devastation - Amazing vs Spirits.
* Roast - To be tested
* Slagstorm - To be tested more, great in non combo meta.
* Sweltering Suns - Great card! Doesn’t do much vs control. Might be worth it anyway as it can be cycled away in slow matchup and be cast in creature matchups.
* Timely Reinforcements - Great card! Note that if you flip it with BBE she is still on the stack and Timely will resolve first. So you can have the creatures and the life.
* Abrade - Great card.
* Ancient Grudge - Great card, compete with Stony Silence in our version.
* Beast Within - Great card that answers everything. Need to be played carefully.
* Fracturing Gust - A dedicated hate piece for Artifact and enchantment decks.
* Nature’s Claim - Not a fan in Valakut as Life total is important to track.
* Path to Exile - Can be amazing but is situational, the land can matter. Bonus point if you path you own Titan for lethal. :)


	Sideboard - A reflection on how to approach different matchups.

Being good at sideboarding is not just knowing what card to take in and out, it’s also learning what role you need to take in a specific matchup while on the play or the draw. As modern evolves, and the decklists are tweaked every week, I won’t go in detail about which card must be sided in or out. To be quite frank, I’m still not 100% sure of everything but here is a condensed version of my experience and what I have learned from Greg Chen’s article:

Affinity
* Affinity is usually faster than you are, so post-board you play like a control deck.  You also want to shave Scapeshifts to avoid clogging your hand with win-cons, and often seven lands Scapeshifts will not be lethal since the deck does not deal much damage to itself. Stony, Knight of Autumn and Anger are great. If you are playing vs the Hardened Scale version, RIP will stop all the modular triggers.

Amulet Combo
* A lot of lists are only playing 1 Pact of Negation these days, so you can try to jam multiple win-cons and force them through the Pact. The matchup is a pure race so cut two Nahiris and Farseeks for Fulminator, Damping Spheres and two Knights. It’s not great but if you can double bolt the Titan in response to the fetch trigger you might be able to survive one more turn.

Ad Nauseam
* One of your worst matchups, you need to hope they stumble game 1. Post-board you can attack their fast mana with artifact hate like Stony Silence and Exile Phyrexian Unlife with Nahiri.

Burn
* Difficult matchup game 1 especially on the draw, but post-board you have access to Knight of Autumn. Primeval Titans come out since they are too slow (since you need to untap and attack with it, and will often die before you can untap with Titan). Note that Nahiri can exile an untapped Eidolon and will attract a lot of damage.

Bogles
* Always be cognizant of how much damage your Scapeshifts can deal since they can gain massive amounts of life. Turn-0 Leyline followed by a Bogle is almost unbeatable Game 1. Game 2 you want Knights and Angers. If they have a slow start you might catch the Bogle with a wrath.

Bant Eldrazi
* Their counterspells postboard hit mostly noncreature spells ( Negate or Stubborn Denial) but sometimes they have Disdainful Stroke or Unified Will. I don’t think Damping Sphere is necessary vs only 4 Temples but Fulminator Mage is good as it can block then destroy their manabase.

Bant Spirits
* You can usually pay for the Wanderer tax and you can bait Queller with Nahiri before Scapeshift. Titan is your best card. Spirits are exponentially strong together, do you best to keep the lowest amount on the board at all time. Anger for one or two spirit is still good.

Blue Moon
* You’ll need to lean on your midrange plan post-board. Sometimes they have the Madcap Experiment + Platinum Emperion combo post-board.

Counters Company
* Their combo kill is faster than yours so you need to keep interaction. If you have only one piece, it is correct to let their turn-1 mana accelerant live and kill the subsequent Devoted Druid.

Dredge
* Game one you can just ramp and ignore their noninteractive strategy, especially on the play. Anger of the Gods and Rest in Peace buy you a lot of time post-board.

Elves
* You need interaction, especially on the draw. Having removal spells post-board helps. Anger is key. You have to pray for interaction and find lethal. 

Eldrazi Tron
* You don't have to discard if you exile [[Reality Smasher]] with Nahiri or kill it with two Valakuts triggers. Knight of Autumn is also super good at gaining life and blocking a TKS.

Grixis Death’s Shadow
* The deck presents a fast clock along with lots of disruption, which is not what TitanShift wants to face. Game 1 usually boils down to who draws more dead cards, and you usually have a couple turns in the midgame to draw a game-winning Titan. Rest in Peace can lock them out of the game and it's harder for them to interact with you if you try to play a more midrange game. It’s often correct to not swing with BBE when cast as you don’t want to help them with Deathshadow. Anyway your game plan is to one shoot them.

GW Company
* End their trip to value town by just killing them with Scapeshift. Watch out for Ghost Quarter + Surgical Extraction games 2 and 3. RIP stop cold their Knights of reliquary and Ramunap Excavator.

Humans
* The disruptive trio of [[Meddling Mage]], [[Kitesail Freebooter]], and [[Thalia, Guardian of Thraben]] makes it difficult for you to ignore your opponent and just ramp into win-cons. You’ll need help from your removal, sweepers, and incidental blockers to buy you more time. Sometimes it can be correct to take a hit off a [[Mantis Rider]] or Thalia so that you can hold up Lightning Bolt for a follow-up [[Meddling Mage]] or [[Kitesail Freebooter]]. Post-board you can cut all your Scapeshifts to make sure you have maximum interaction (and you don’t want to clog your hand with too many win-cons). A resolved Titan should be sufficient to close out most games. 

Hollow One
* Some players will side out some number of Burning Inquiry due to potential Obstinate Baloth, but Baloth is still a good blocker that will buy you time. Scapeshifts are shaved to minimize the impact of the multiple Collective Brutalities, as well as the incoming Blood Moon(s). Knight of Autumn and RIP are amazing in the matchup. Knight will hit Hollow One, Blood Moon and can be paired with a Sakura to block a Flameblade Adept. Once declared blocker you can still sac Sakura for the land, Knight and Adept will trade. Nahiri will also exile Blood Moon, and creatures.

Infect
* Hope to dodge this matchup. You absolutely need to keep hands with interaction with them or else you will get run over. You will never be able to race them, you can mulligan aggressively for interaction and hope to kill their only infecter. NEVER interact with them during combat step. Sorcery speed and/or end step.

Jund
* You want to deploy ramp spells before they’re discarded. You have a great midrange plan post-board between Bloodbraid Elf, Knight of Autumn, and Tireless Tracker, which will punish them for putting in clunky cards like Fulminator Mage. The matchup is easy as long as they don’t play Liliana of the Veil on turn three. If they do, you can sometimes race them with a Nahiri. Lili can ultimate turn 6 while Nahiri will ultimate turn 5.

Jeskai Control
* Similarly to UW, Jeskai is forced to answer your creatures that you have already gained incidental value off of.

Living end
* Sakura-Tribe is amazing against them since it comes back after Living End. Sometimes you can fetch all basics to play around Fulminator Mage. Don’t forget they can disrupt your Scapeshifts with a Beast Within on a Mountain after Scapeshift resolves, so I like to grab seven Mountains + a Valakut if possible. You can pitch Primeval Titan to Nahiri and if they don’t have Faerie Macabre they will likely hold off on casting Living End.

Lantern
* Take the draw versus Lantern Control games 2 and 3 because they become longer and grindier, so raw card advantage is more important than taking the play. There is a consensus among the Lantern Control community that being on the draw in this matchup is better than being on the play. You can easily grind them out with Tireless Tracker and your artifact destruction spells. Game 1 is hard since you have no outs to Ensnaring Bridge + Witchbane Orb. Also, they can't interact with cascade well so if you are lucky enough you can flip into a Knight or Stony. Nahiri can exile tapped artifacts, if for some reason they have it tapped during your turn you might need to consider this option. Corner case scenario: You can ult Nahiri for a Knight and destroy a bridge if you have lethal on board. If they regenerate, the bridge will be tapped so you can exile the bridge with another Nahiri.

Mardu Pyromancer
* They will disrupt you early in the game, but they are slow to close games and a sweeper tags most of their creatures outside of Bedlam Reveler.  Watch out against Molten Rain + Surgical Extraction on a Valakut, as well as the Blood Moons they bring in. Your midrange beaters can punish them if they spend their turns trying to disrupt you with Blood Moon and Surgical Extraction. Rest in Peace destroys their game plan and protect you from surgical. Knight of Autumn is also great at killing Blood Moon or beating down.

Ponza
* You can outramp their land destruction spells, but Blood Moon stops you cold. You need to transform into a G/R midrange deck post-board. You can cut some Scapeshifts as you won’t likely have the lands or there will be a Blood Moon in play. Fetch your basics as soon as possible.

Storm
* One of the combo decks you do not want to sit across from, as they are way faster than you and have Remand/Unsubstantiate to slow you down. You need to keep them off-balance with a removal spell to the cost-reducer while enacting your own game plan, which can be difficult. [[Damping Sphere]] will help a lot with this matchup. Bring in at least one Anger to answer their goblins. You can punish their attack with a cost-reducer with Nahiri too. Once into play she will win by herself as they don’t have much to interact with.

Tron
* This matchup is purely a race, with you hoping to fade turn-3 Karn Liberated or turn-4 Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger. Bloodbraid Elf does a fantastic job of harassing their planeswalkers. Fulminator mage, Stony Silence and Damping Sphere can cut dry their manabase. You won’t have much use of your bolts/helixes.

Titan Shift
* Staying at 19 life can be critical to avoid dying to a seven land Scapeshift. But most of the time you will not have that luxury. Bring in Knight of Autumn for lifegain and potential Witchbane Orb. Fulminator mage will will just be a “counterspell” for their ramps.

U/W Control
* U/W Control has many dead cards against you game 1 and a very slow clock. Apply pressure with Bloodbraid Elf, the occasional Sakura-Tribe Elder, Valakut triggers, and wait for a window to jam multiple win-cons in one turn (such as double Scapeshift with 8 mana). I probably fear Search for Azcanta the most since it shifts the inevitability back to them. Nahiri and Knight of Autumn can hit Runed Halos, Spreading Seas, and unflipped Search for Azcantas. Game two you will remove some Farseek and Bolts/Helix to bring in all the gas you have: Tracker, Knights, Fulmi and RIP (protect Valakut from extraction and stop their Field of Ruin/Crucible gameplan). If possible don’t sac you fetches and don’t expose your Valakuts. Once you have a clock, don’t overextend as they can easily punish you for that. 

U/R Phoenix
* You can’t beat their best draw but they won’t expect to have their Thing in the Ice exiled by Nahiri or a Lightning Helix on a Phoenix. Game two you will need Damping Spheres, RIP (not great but will do) and Angers. Titan is awkward as it can die to a flipped TiTi and might be too late.

U/R Breach
* Their Blood Moons and counterspells buy them so much time and their combo is just lights-out. Always jam since you can’t afford to give them extra draw steps. 

W/B Eldrazi Taxes
* Note that Wasteland Strangler can process your suspended Search for Tomorrows, but it must always have a target for its -3/-3 effect, including itself. If you ever see a Vial on 1 and they purposely did not tick it up, that signifies Burrenton Forge-Tender. Knights are great to kill the Tidehollow Sculler and block. You will have trouble reaching 7 lands so you can transform into a Midrange Rg deck.

8-Rack
* Take the draw in this matchup. Knight of Autumn is a beast and will buy you a lot of time and life against their Rack-effects. BBE and tracker are your best cards as they have trouble dealing with them plus the extra cards.




**Gameplay, Tips and tricks - Corner case situations	**

Quick note on the mulligan - as said in the introduction you should be trying to have some acceleration to reach you end game faster. However, you may already know that in some matchups it’s more important to be able to first stabilise. Trying to do so might force you to keep some hands without acceleration but interactions/sideboard cards. Make sure to know what role you should have in different matchups. As a rule of thumb you can always assume you will need to take the control seat vs decks faster than you and adopt an aggressive gameplan when facing slower decks.

	How to Scapeshift? How many Valakuts do I need? What card should I worry about?
    
The basic maths for Scapeshift are simple. If you want to maximise the amount of damage, you will take six mountains plus the maximum number of Valakuts. If some are already in play, keep them and add more mountains, if possible. 
Note that sometimes, if games are long, you will have to play with these numbers. Considering the number of mountains and valakuts in play and in your library. For example, if I have 10 Mountains in play - 3 mountain and 4 Valakuts in the deck - the maximum amount of damage I can produce is 3 Mountains x 4 Valakuts x 3 Damage = 36. I will sacrifice 7 lands, keeping at least 3 Mountain in play. So my 3 Mountains entering the field will see the others and trigger all 4 Valakuts three times. As everything in our deck will deal a multiple of 3 (Bolt, BBE, Valakut, Titan), it sometimes help to think about the damage in number of triggers and not in actual numbers. I’m just focusing on “I need x trigger to win”.

It is possible to interact with Valakut triggers, not by removing Valakut itself but the Mountains. If they can reduce your number of mountain to 5 or lower, all except one triggers will fizzle on resolution as the trigger from the mountain they removed will still see the other 5 mountains. You need to pay attention to theses cards:

* Field of Ruin or Ghost Quarter - Will work the exact same way with the combo: You will need to have 1 basic mountain in your deck per land to keep the triggers.
* Fulminator mage - You will see it coming, just fetch one more Mountain
* Cryptic Command - some tricky player might let you resolve it on 7 lands and just bounce one mountain on resolution taking only 3 damage. This way they will get rid of many potential triggers and might put you in a weird spot if you just fetched all basics to close the game.
* Beast within - Not played that much but pay attention to it vs Living End.
