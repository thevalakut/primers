# RUGShift, a primer
By Brandon Moes

## Introduction

Back in the [Splinter Twin](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Splinter%20Twin) days one of the best ways to combo win with Valakut was through the use of counterspells. To make sure you could get to your kill, you had to make sure your opponent didn’t get to their kill. While the RUG version has fallen out of flavour for the faster RG version, there is still some merit to playing the blue-based version of [Scapeshift](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Scapeshift).

The way the RUG version of the deck wins is essentially play lands, ramp, and tempo your opponent until you can cast Scapeshift and deal 18+ damage. To do this you play spells like [Remand](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Remand) and [Cryptic Command](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Cryptic%20Command) to counter your opponent’s threats or fog their attacks.

## Why this deck?

**Over Titanshift?**

Great question. The main reason for me is the play-style and I have been playing it for a long time. For others they won’t play a deck if it doesn’t have blue. The tempo combo finish gameplan is the type of game I want to play. 

**Why not BTL?**

Another great question. BTL is often seen as having a clunky and painful manabase and when I was playing the deck I definitely agreed. RUG has much less of a painful manabase and you don’t need to worry about getting your fourth colour for your win condition.

## Core, Manabase, and Flex

The core of the deck has changed recently since the printing of Modern Horizons. There is a couple versions of the deck. The core cards in every RUG scapeshift deck however rarely change.

* 4 [Scapeshift](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Scapeshift)
* 4 [Cryptic Command](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Cryptic%20Command)
* 4 [Remand](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Remand)
* 4 [Search for Tomorrow](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Search%20for%20Tomorrow)
* 4 [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Sakura-Tribe%20Elder) / [Growth Sprial](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Growth%20Sprial)
* 2 [Snapcaster Mage](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Snapcaster%20Mage)

After the spells, we have the lands of which you would typically run 25-26:

* 4 [Steam Vents](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Steam%20Vents)
* 4 [Stomping Ground](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Stomping%20Ground)
* 2 [Breeding Pool](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Breeding%20Pool)
* 4 [Misty Rainforest](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Misty%20Rainforest)
* 2 [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Valakut,%20the%20Molten%20Pinnacle)
* 7-8 Basics
* 1-2 ([Flooded Grove](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Flooded%20Grove), [Cinder Glade](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Cinder%20Glade), extra [Breeding Pool](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Breeding%20Pool), Extra Fetch, etc)

So, what does that leave us to work with?

If we make an assumption that we are going to run 25 lands, like most lists, and the core, we will have 15 slots to work with. To fill these slots we need to add removal, and dig to get to our combo finish. You typically run 4-6 removal spells/sweepers, 4-6 dig spells, and 3-7 other flex slots which can be used for a combination of the two or whatever suits your fancy.

## Removal / Sweeper Options

* [Lightning Bolt](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Lightning%20Bolt) - One mana 3 damage, kills a lot of important need-to-kill creatures in the format and can be used to help get your opponent to that needed 18 life.

* [Flame Slash](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Flame%20Slash) - One mana deal 4 to creatures is nice especially for the TiTi running around right now but often you will want an instant speed way to deal damage instead.

* [Magmatic Sinkhole](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Magmatic%20Sinkhole) - I have yet to test this, but it is likely similar to Harvest Pyre.

* [Harvest Pyre](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Harvest%20Pyre) - Useful for the creatures with greater than 3 toughness, may be worth it as we put a few cards in the bin with ramping and such

* [Izzet Charm](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Izzet%20Charm) - a great instant-speed Faithless Looting, with the option to be a counterspell or removal in a pinch.

* [Into the Roil](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Into%20the%20Roil) / [Blink of an Eye](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Blink%20of%20an%20Eye) - A temporary removal option but is good for delve threats as well as for blood moon, planeswalkers, and other annoying permanents.

* [Repeal](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Repeal) - Great versatile bounce spell and replaces itself.

* [Anger of the Gods](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Anger%20of%20the%20Gods) - Very good against dredge and other low to the ground creature deck. Overall a very healthy sweeper.

* [Sweltering Suns](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Sweltering%20Suns) - Great against low to the ground creature builds, can be a timewalk against dredge, and at worse case cycles when you don’t need it

* [Pyroclasm](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Pyroclasm) - Formerly the sweeper of choice but nowadays it doesn’t answer what it needs to.

* [Kozilek’s Return](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Kozilek’s%20Return) - An instant speed pyroclasm (notably colourless), but likely doesn’t see play due to pyroclasm’s issue.

* [Electrolyze](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Electrolyze) - Not played too often, might see a resurgence if infect and other mana dork decks become more played

## Dig options

* [Izzet Charm](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Izzet%20Charm) - see above

* [Peer Through Depths](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Peer%20Through%20Depths) - Sees 5 cards deep for two mana and can grab a counter or a Scapeshift. Only grabs instants or sorceries.

* [Anticipate](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Anticipate) - Sees only 3 deep for two mana with the flexibility of any card.

* [Supreme Will](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Supreme%20Will) - Sees 4 deep for 3 mana, but can also act as a mana leak if necessary

* [Search for Azcanta](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Search%20for%20Azcanta) - Has the added bonus of becoming a land, however you don’t often want to mill the top card of your library and is often slow.

* [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Jace,%20the%20Mind%20Sculptor) - A very powerful dig spell as you can put mountains back on top of your library with the 0 ability and shuffle them away with a ramp spell. Great in a grindy meta.

* [Narset, Parter of Veils](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Narset,%20Parter%20of%20Veils) - Very similar to Search for Azcanta, but can be activated right away. Can also slow down a Phoenix play drastically.

* [Fact or Fiction](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Fact%20or%20Fiction) - Another new player from MH1, often is a draw 3 and can be cast after waiting a turn holding up Cryptic Command.

* [[Serum Visions, Opt, Sleight of Hand]] - Not as great as in other combo decks as this deck does shuffle quite a bit and it’s awkward to find time to cast these. Opt is probably the best of these.

## Other Flex / Value / Utility Slots

* [Snapcaster Mage](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Snapcaster%20Mage) - Very good card to have as this deck plays almost all instants and sorceries. Great for making tempo plays, or blocking as an ambush viper. Typically a 2-of at most.

* [Mission Briefing](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Mission%20Briefing) - A creatureless version of Snapcaster Mage with the added requirement of a double U casting cost. Can be used to dig before flashing back a spell, but is often just the budget version of Snapcaster Mage.

* [Ice-Fang Coatl](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Ice-Fang%20Coatl) - New from MH1, similar to a Baleful Strix, it draws when it enters the battlefield and can have deathtouch assuming you’re running snow basics. Not too difficult to turn on and can be a cycle in a pinch as it has flash.

* [Engineered Explosives](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Engineered%20Explosives) - Very good at clearing the board of pesky permanents or creatures. Especially against decks such as Whir, Elves, and Humans.

* [Prismatic Omen](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Prismatic%20Omen) - Typically in the 4-Valakut RUG lists that are not only aiming to win with Scapeshift but attempt to use this as a colour-fixing ramp spell.

* [Spell Snare](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Spell%20Snare) - Fallen off the map quite a bit with Jund losing traction but might see an uptick in playability soon.

* [Explore](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Explore) - generally outclassed by Growth Spiral.

* [Gigadrowse](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Gigadrowse) - Used as a pseudo-Cryptic Command to tap down an opponents team, or to tap down your opponent’s lands to give a (mostly) clear path to Scapeshift.

## Sideboard Options

So, now that we have the maindeck components out of the way, let’s talk about the sideboard and our options. Our main focus is to stall the opponent until we can win with Scapeshift, however after sideboard this can change slightly.

**Creatures:**

For some of the slower matchups where our opponents have a lot of removal they often take most of it out as we don’t play many creatures in the main. After sideboard we can bring in cards to take advantage of this.

Some examples of big beaters we can play in the side include [Obstinate Baloth](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Obstinate%20Baloth), [Thrun the Last Troll](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Thrun%20the%20Last%20Troll), [Carnage Tyrant](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Carnage%20Tyrant), [Inferno Titan](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Inferno%20Titan), [Surrak Dragonclaw](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Surrak%20Dragonclaw), and [Vendilion Clique](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Vendilion%20Clique).

**Lifegain:**

This has been a mainstay in a lot of sideboard for a long time now but is getting less and less sb slots designated for it over time.

Examples of lifegain value cards are [Obstinate Baloth](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Obstinate%20Baloth), [Feed the Clan](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Feed%20the%20Clan), [Weather the Storm](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Weather%20the%20Storm), and [Thragtusk](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Thragtusk).

**Counterspells:**

While we run quite a few in the main, sometimes you just need that little bit extra.

Examples are [Dispel](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Dispel), [Negate](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Negate), [Force of Negation](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Force%20of%20Negation), [Glen-Elendra Archmage](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Glen-Elendra%20Archmage), and [Flusterstorm](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Flusterstorm).

**Sweepers and Graveyard Hate**

The sweepers will typically be the same as the main board. Graveyard hate is growing to become more and more necessary as time goes on.

Some examples include [Ravenous Trap](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Ravenous%20Trap), [Surgical Extraction](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Surgical%20Extraction), [Grafdigger’s Cage](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Grafdigger’s%20Cage), and [Relic of Progenitus](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Relic%20of%20Progenitus).

**Artifact and Enchantment Removal**

Sometimes you have to take out some pesky artifacts like [Spellskite](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Spellskite) or [Witchbane Orb](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Witchbane%20Orb), and sometimes it’s an enchantment like [Leyline of Sanctity](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Leyline%20of%20Sanctity).

Some options for removal are [Ancient Grudge](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Ancient%20Grudge), [Abrade](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Abrade), [Force of Vigor](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Force%20of%20Vigor), [Krosan Grip](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Krosan%20Grip), [Nature’s Claim](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Nature’s%20Claim), [Shatterstorm](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Shatterstorm), [Creeping Corrosion](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Creeping%20Corrosion), and [Fracturing Gust](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Fracturing%20Gust).


Now that we’ve got all the components of a shift list…. Let’s look at a few decklists.

This list comes packing for dredge and Hogaak hate main with relics and angers.

The slightly faster more combo-focused gameplan Omenshift. More Valakuts, means more possible damage. With an Omen in play you can Scapeshift on six lands getting 4 Valakut and 2 fetchlands you can deal 72 damage, and on your next turn fetch to deal an additional 24 damage.

This is the list I came up with when MH1 was fully spoiled. It does something that most Scapeshift lists don’t do and that’s play 0 Sakura-Tribe Elder. While Sakura-Tribe Elder is often a chump blocker that ramps, RUG just does not have the tools to remove most big threats. While a chump blocker that ramps is great, but a blocker that helps stall most combat, flies, replaces itself, and has FLASH, is very good. You often want to hold mana up on 2 and this plus growth spiral plus remand gives you the best of the options.

Of course, this list is a work and progress and the SB might need some attention.
