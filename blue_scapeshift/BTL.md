# Bring to Light Scapeshift Primer

*by Matthew Johnson - updated Jun 2019*

Bring to Light is a 4-colour combo-control deck centered around the ability to tutor up the best card for the moment with [Bring to Light](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Bring%20to%20Light). It is a deck full of interaction that you can tailor for the particular matchup and metagame. You specifically want to be able to get [Scapeshift](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Scapeshift) to have a combo kill with [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Valakut,%20the%20Molten%20Pinnacle), which you can use as early as turn 4. This commits you to running 4 colours. Blue and Green are required by Bring to Light and Red is implied by the number of mountains required for the Scapeshift kill.

## Variants

There are three principle variants. Two decks where Blue/Green are the primary colours and one which is base Black/Green/Red and Blue is the splash.

The base-Blue decks are centered around counter spells, particularly [Cryptic Command](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Cryptic%20Command) and [Remand](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Remand). The splash colours enable Bring to Light with four colours and control cards, usually removal.

The base-Black deck is centered around discard and board control rather than counter spells.

The choice between Black and White as the splash is largely determined by which sideboard cards you want to play and which main-deck removal spells are good in the current meta.

The base-Black deck is best in metas where counter spells, particularly Remand, are bad. Discard gives you earlier interaction for faster formats and having more black lands and less reliance on having triple-Blue for Cryptic allows you to cast black removal earlier as well.

## The Core

The core of the deck is the ramp, mana base and win conditions.

**Ramp:**

* 4 [Search for Tomorrow](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Search%20for%20Tomorrow)
* 4 [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Sakura-Tribe%20Elder)
* 1 two-land ramp spell (usually either [Hunting Wilds](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Hunting%20Wilds) or [Kodama's Reach](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Kodama's%20Reach))

**Win conditions:**

* 4 [Bring to Light](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Bring%20to%20Light)
* 2 [Scapeshift](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Scapeshift)

**Mana base:**

* 2 [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Valakut,%20the%20Molten%20Pinnacle)
* 4 [Stomping Ground](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Stomping%20Ground)
* 4 Green-x fetches ([Misty Rainforest](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Misty%20Rainforest) or [Verdant Catacombs](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Verdant%20Catacombs))
* 4 Red-x Shocklands ([Steam Vents](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Steam%20Vents) or [Blood Crypt](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Blood%20Crypt)s)
* 1 [Breeding Pool](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Breeding%20Pool)
* 1 [Watery Grave](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Watery%20Grave)
* 1 [Overgrown Tomb](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Overgrown%20Tomb)
* 8 Basic lands (including 2 [Mountain](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Mountain), 2 [Forest](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Forest), 1 [Island](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Island), 1 [Swamp](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Swamp))
* 1 flex slot ([Overgrown Tomb](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Overgrown%20Tomb) #2, [Cinder Glade](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Cinder%20Glade), [Flooded Grove](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Flooded%20Grove), [Blood Crypt](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Blood%20Crypt))

Variant-specific land notes are below, but one comment on the basic Mountains here. Since the printing of [Field of Ruin](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Field%20of%20Ruin) and [Assassin's Trophy](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Assassin's%20Trophy) there's a higher number of land destruction cards which replace with a land. We need to be able to get a basic after Scapeshift if they destroy a Mountain in response to the triggers to avoid the triggers fizzling, so we run two to ensure we always have one to get. For white-splash versions switch the black-producing lands to the direct white equivalent.

This is 41 cards, leaving 19 cards specific to the different types.

## General Strategy

The deck is trying to win with a single-turn combo kill, so all the rest of your game plan is setting it up and protecting it and you until you can execute it. Because of that the deck plays a lot more like a BUG or Jund control deck, which happens to finish with Scapeshift. Bring to Light is a powerful tool which can be a win condition but also executes your tap-out control plan by getting all your main-deck and sideboard singletons. having a 4-of tutor lets you get the right card at the right time.

The main consideration when you're playing is ensuring your mana base. It's rare that you can play a game without ramp, so your opening hands you're looking for one with ramp and reasonable access to colours. After that, interaction is more important than having a win condition. With access to 6 scapeshifts plus other win conditions you will usually be able to draw into it.

It's important to think carefully about which lands you fetch and in which order. The mana base has a lot of one-ofs and you have quite ambitious mana costs. Most of your ramp spells will only get basics, of which you have a lot, but you also want to take care to preserve your life total in several matchups, so you may want to fetch basics, assuming you can make all the colours work. Playing your mana around [Blood Moon](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Blood%20Moon) is also very important. Generally as long as you have at least one green source you can draw out of it, since ramp spells are live.

It's usually right to play a ramp spell on turn 2 and start holding up interaction after that. Getting to 4 mana is important since it gives you access to Cryptic and some of your other good spells, or casting multiple spells in a turn.

After securing your mana base, play a board-control game until you can land a finisher. It's usually right to use a Bring to Light early for either ramp or removal. Particularly post-board you may have a haymaker you can get on turn 3 or 4 with Bring to Light. In some matchups that's [Madcap Experiment](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Madcap%20Experiment) which you may have pre-board. Using a Bring to Light early makes [Snapcaster Mage](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Snapcaster%20Mage) an out as a win condition later.

**Counting with Scapeshift:**

The most common numbers are:

* 1 Valakut 6 Mountains is 18 damage
* 1 Valakut 7 Mountains is 21 damage
* 2 Valakut 6 Mountains is 36 damage
* 2 Valakut 4 Mountains is 24 damage

Options where you only have 6 mountains in play you need to take care that they can't destroy one without you replacing it (for example, [Ghost Quarter](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Ghost%20Quarter) and you can still get a Basic Mountain). In that case all but one trigger will fizzle because there aren't enough mountains. You also only have 10 or 11 mountains in this build and two Valakuts. This means you need to be careful how many you fetch of each and know how many are left when you go for the Scapeshift. The second Valakut can allow you to leave some Mountains in play and fetch a smaller number which is still lethal.

## Base-Blue variants

**Mana base:**

For Blue builds the mana base options are Misty Rainforest, Steam Vents and 3 Islands, 2 Mountains, 2 Forest and 1 Swamp. The flex slot can be any of the listed options depending on how many Mountains you want and how many Black sources, which will depend on the rest of your deck choices. You need at least 10 Mountains in the deck, but I recommend 11 if you can at all manage it. There can be situations that you run the risk of running out. For White-splash build replace Swamp, Overgrown Tomb, Watery Grave with [Plains](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Plains), [Temple Garden](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Temple%20Garden), [Hallowed Fountain](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Hallowed%20Fountain) and optionally Blood Crypt with [Sacred Foundry](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Sacred%20Foundry). 

**Counter spells:**

In the main deck we typically play 3 Cryptic Commands and 3 Remands and a flex slot or two. Options for other counterspells include:

* [Izzet Charm](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Izzet%20Charm) - Flexible counter spell, removal and card selection.
* [Ojutai's Command](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Ojutai's%20Command) - Provides life gain and combos with both Sakura-Tribe Elder and Snapcaster Mage, cantripping like Cryptic Command while having a significantly easier casting cost. Main-deck help for the burn matchup.

For further options see Sideboard cards below. 

**Removal:**

Typically the deck will play at least one sweeper, usually a four mana hard wrath, plus either 0 or 1 [Anger of the Gods](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Anger%20of%20the%20Gods) and a number of point removal spells.

The wrath is typically either:

* [Damnation](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Damnation) if playing Black.
* [Supreme Verdict](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Supreme%20Verdict) if playing White.

Both uncounterability and the regeneration clause are relevent in the format. White gets to choose and can run [Wrath of God](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Wrath%20of%20God) instead, but usually uncounterability is the choice if it's available.

Anger of the Gods is main deck when graveyard strategies are good or go-wide aggro strategies where you need to wrath earlier and often. If not, you can forego the maindeck copy and just bring one in from the side.

Removal options include:

* [Lightning Bolt](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Lightning%20Bolt) - A generic catch-all which also can be removal for Planeswalkers and can reduce the opponent's life total below 18 for matchups which don't take pain from their mana base.
* [Fatal Push](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Fatal%20Push) - One of the reasons to play black. Deals with many high-toughness threats for only one mana, such as Tarmogoyf and Death's Shadow. Care should be taken when you need to kill three and four CMC threats, since your only ways to enable revolt are 4 fetch lands and Sakura-Tribe Elder.
* [Abrupt Decay](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Abrupt%20Decay) - Flexible removal for any permanent type and the uncounterability is relevant. Creature lands and some 4-CMC threats (such as Thought-Knot Seer) are a reason that Fatal Push can still be better. Kills Blood Moon.
* [Assassin's Trophy](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Assassin's%20Trophy) - Hard removal for permanents of all types, toughness and mana costs. The downside of getting a land is definitely real, but we're not trying to go long, often just needing to stall long enough to get to our win condition. Kills Blood Moon and interacts with Tron lands.
* [Path to Exile](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Path%20to%20Exile) - If Path to Exile is good then this is one of the draws of playing the white splash. It will answer any creature of any size or mana cost.

The above can often be present in multiples. There are also some other options which are usually only found as one-ofs:

* [Terminate](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Terminate) - A good option if you want a hard removal spell for things you can't Push or Decay. Somewhat replaced by Assassin's Trophy, but doesn't have the downside and does have the no-regen clause.
* [Sultai Charm](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Sultai%20Charm) - Another main-deckable option for destroying Blood Moon, Leyline of Sanctity or other permanent-based hate. The mono-coloured restriction is not a free-roll with Humans, Spirits and Eldrazi in the format, but it usually has targets even in those matchups. The backup mode is very good though, you don't go down a card like you do with Izzet Charm.
* [Maelstrom Pulse](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Maelstrom%20Pulse) - Another catch-all card which can answer Blood Moon. Mostly eclipsed by either Sultai Charm or Assassin's Trophy, but the ability to catch things in multiples can be useful.
* [Deathsprout](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Deathsprout) - The double-black in this makes it hard to play in the blue-based builds, but is great in the black-based build. there's often occasions where you are casting an early Bring to Light and want to ramp but really need some interaction. Being an instant is also great if you draw it naturally.
* [Jund Charm](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Jund%20Charm) - If graveyard decks are particularly rampant this is an option to play some graveyard interaction while also having another use as an instant-speed pyroclasm. Only doing 2 damage can be a significant disadvantage compared to Anger of the Gods, so it's a metagame decision whether this is good enough.

Most of these options are black, except for Path to Exile and if you want to lean more on removal then having black as your splash is recommended. If you think that Lightning Bolt is good in the metagame then it is possible to play with just Bolt and a sweeper as your removal spell, which allows you to pick either splash. With Modern Horizons graveyard-based decks are at a peak in the format, against which exile effects are very important which could lean towards Path to Exile - although on the sideboard side you do get Rest in Peace, but it's possible that's not fast enough and black for Leyline of the Void is necessary.

**Win conditions:**
 
While our main plan is to win with Scapeshift, it is important to have a secondary win condition. If that win condition can be fetched with Bring to Light then one card can be five ways to play it. Your choice of other win conditions also affects the number of Scapeshifts that you play. Generally you should play either two or three. It is possible to just play a fourth Cryptic Command over the third Scapeshift, but usually you want to play a win condition in that slot.

* [Madcap Experiment](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Madcap%20Experiment) - This one-card combo with [Platinum Emperion](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Platinum%20Emperion) can be fetched by Bring to Light as early as turn three. It's excellent against burn (one of the few ways to have a good pre-board matchup against them) and Elves (which is a free win game one). It's also very good against the other creature and tribal decks, although they will often have some way to remove it, so you may have a choice of whether to fetch this or your sweeper if you're casting Bring to Light. Other matchups it can be a road bump (storm needs +8 and can't win with goblins, ad naus can't win with Lightning Storm) and removing it with Path does accelerate you to Scapeshift. The downside of Madcap is poor hands when you draw the Platinum Emperion, slightly increasing the number of hands you'll need to mulligan. It is possible to hard cast, however, so drawing it isn't terminal.
* [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Jace,%20the%20Mind%20Sculptor) - Jace is in the abstract a very good card and is also very castable in this deck. You can't get it with Bring to Light, but it is very good at digging you to win conditions. If you can untap with Jace you can usually get a lot of value from it, however there are many matchups in modern where tapping out for a 4-drop which doesn't affect the board match is not good.
* [Hunting Wilds](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Hunting%20Wilds) vs [Kodama's Reach](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Kodama's%20Reach) - There's always one of these two in the deck, but there are pros and cons for both. Hunting Wilds has the advantage of being a genuine win condition in its own right, and sometimes just naturally triggering Valakuts. It also puts two lands straight into play. The argument for Kodama's Reach is that you can Bring it to Light with only three colours. While you only get one into play (and it can only get basics), it is often the case that by land 7 you don't have another land to play from hand anyway, which means it's not a downside, and can even be an upside, since the second one can come into play untapped. Note that you can't Hunting Wilds with kicker under a Blood Moon, since you probably don't put any forests into play, they're now mountains.

These are the alternative win conditions played in the main deck. There will always be several more creatures available to bring in post board to try and play around hate for your main plan, as well as for their disruptive utility. For more on those, see Sideboard cards.

**Utility creatures:**

* [Snapcaster Mage](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Snapcaster%20Mage) - Snapcaster Mage is great at rebuying ramp, counters, removal and early Bring to Lights which got board control into being win conditions. It combos particularly well with Cryptic Command and there should always be at least one in the deck. Two is very reasonable although you don't normally go above that.
* [Kess, Dissident Mage](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Kess,%20Dissident%20Mage) - Another option for rebuying spells and also offering a decent (flying) blocker and a non-trivial clock, so can double as a win condition in a pinch. You can only get spells with it on your turn, which makes it better in the Jund build where you don't have so many counterspells. You can still use a counter spell from the yard to protect your combo turn.
* [Ice-Fang Coatl](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Ice-Fang%20Coatl) - This is an option if you want to lean on playing at instant speed. It gives you some velocity through your deck and also tempo gain from blocking. If you can turn on the deathtouch then it can be a true two-for-one, which you can do by playing snow-covered basic lands and fetching appropriately. 

**Library manipulation:**

* [Teferi, Time Raveler](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Teferi,%20Time%20Raveler) - Teferi offers marginal value on several axis. Bounce a creature draw a card is a very useful ability for us, akin to remand in the tempo swing from them to us. The static ability is also very good for us in control matchups. In that regard it takes a similar role to Glen Elendra in that it's a preemptive counterspell to protect our combo. The plus ability on Teferi is a lot more marginal. Many of our spells are either creatures or already instants, although Bring to Light itself is a great thing to cast during combat - using it to win isn't needed because of the static.
* [Narset, Parter of Veils](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Narset,%20Parter%20of%20Veils) - Like Teferi, Narset has both card selection and a disruptive element. In the abstract they're probably more powerful - you get a Dig Through Time where half of it has suspend one and turning off card draw from the opponent is very strong. That said, against control specifically being able to turn off counterspells for the rest of the game is probably better since finding the first win condition is not often the problem. Having no way to impact the board can also be problematic.
* [Fact or Fiction](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Fact%20or%20Fiction) - Fact or Fiction has a long and storied history. In theory it does exactly what we want - draw lots of cards or pick one card which swings the game. Being castable off a single blue can also be very relevant and makes it quite castable under a Blood Moon. The downside of Fact or Fiction is firstly that you only have a few flex slots for 4+ mana cost cards. It also can be relevant that the non-selected cards go to the graveyard. In a deck which has so many 1-of and 2-of cards, particularly lands, the choice is not free.
* [Worldly Counsel](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Worldly%20Counsel) - This is usually Impulse and almost always at least Anticipate. The ability to get any type is important as you're often looking for lands as much as spells. For pure ability to dig this is probably the best option and in the standard Blue builds I'd probably recommend one or two.
* [Search for Azcanta](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Search%20for%20Azcanta) - In theory Search is great. Filtering early and late it ramps you and digs for win conditions. It can be a little slow to get online, however. When you're using counterspells you're typically filling your graveyard a little slower, particularly with only four fetches. I wouldn't play more than one in the base Blue builds. In the discard-focussed list it's a bit better, since you're both filling your graveyard faster and slowing down the opponent's plan to allow it time to get online.

**Additional Ramp:**

* [Farseek](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Farseek) - You often want a tenth ramp spell and this is the default with no other considerations. It fetches all of your duals, particularly if you're playing the one you can't fetch with your fetch lands (eg Blood Crypt with Mistys).
* [Prismatic Omen](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Prismatic%20Omen) - Prismatic Omen can be a bit like a ramp spell, with some upside. It doesn't get you to an early Bring to Light quicker, which is a big downside, given the speed of the format, particularly post board when you want to hit your silver bullets. However, it allows you to scapeshift off 6 lands, fixes for Cryptic Command, even under a Blood Moon (it goes on timestamps) and can give you some higher damage lines if your opponent is on a high life total or you're short on mountains. Probably best in a three-Scapeshift, no one-ofs build.
* [Growth Spiral](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Growth%20Spiral) - A good card in an unknown meta, not great but not terrible against anything. It allows you to hold up remand on turn 2 without foregoing ramp, but does require you to have the extra land already to put into play. Good with Snapcaster Mage, but likely to always be your first cut when sideboarding. You're unlikely to play more than Two.

**Suggested lists:**

* [Black to Light](../decklists/Bring%20To%20Light%20-%20RUG%20splash%20Black.md)
* [Bring to White](../decklists/Bring%20To%20Light%20-%20RUG%20splash%20White.md)

## Base-Black variants

**Mana base:**

For Black builds the mana base options are Verdant Catacombs, Blood Crypt and 1 Island, 2 Mountains, 3 Forest and 2 Swamps. The flex slot is either Steam Vents or Overgrown Tomb depending on the number of Mountains you want (see above) and Green/Black sources. Without Cryptic the mana costs are a little easier to cast, so we only need 3 U/B sources not 4.

**Discard:**

The reason to play the base-Black build is when you think that discard spells are more powerful than counterspells. You want to run at least five, above that you can flex between removal and discard as you want. [Thoughtseize](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Thoughtseize) is definitely the most powerful and the format staple for the effect, with [Inquisition of Kozilek](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Inquisition%20of%20Kozilek) as the obvious second choice. You might want a split more like 3 Thoughtseize, 2 Inquisition to try and preserve your life total a little, rather than necessarily all four Thoughtseize.

**Removal choices:**

One of the important things to note about discard over counterspells is that it's worse in matchups where they can top-deck big haymakers. In modern this largely means Tron. The printing that has made this setup possible is [Assassin's Trophy](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Assassin's%20Trophy), which gives you a main-deck way to keep them off their big mana engine. It also allows you to have main-deck outs to Blood Moon. A good number of Assassin's Trophy is required to shore up the Tron matchup.

Having a mana base which supports early black also allows you to go heavy on black-based removal such as [Fatal Push](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Fatal%20Push). Running a 3/3 split of Push and Trophy as your point-removal suite is very reasonable. You will also want to have the standard one Damnation and probably an Anger of the Gods, which is again easier to have the mana for when you don't have any triple colour in the deck.

**Utility choices:**

One of the effects of playing discard is to fill your graveyard quicker and also slow the opponent's game plan. As such, I think that [Search for Azcanta](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Search%20for%20Azcanta) is quite a bit better in this version than the blue ones. The other card which gains Snapcaster Mage and I would go up to at least two between those and Kess in this version. Other than that I'd probably try and keep blue spells to a minimum and focus on the Red, Green and Black, although you'll also have some more blue spells in the sideboard

**Suggested list:**

[Jund to Light](../decklists/Bring%20To%20Light%20-%20Jund.md)

## Sideboard cards

Madcap Experiment is one of the things which varies between pilots. Most people will have it somewhere in the 75, although not everyone plays it main. If you're running Madcap then you can't have other artifacts in the 75, since you can't risk hitting them from the Madcap. This primer assumes that you are playing it and so this discussion here will ignore artifacts.

Your sideboard will need a mix of the things below. Graveyard hate can be skipped in appropriate metas, but you'll want some things from all the categories below. One of the main things to do is to ensure you have alternative threats for game two since many people will be finding ways to interact with your main plan. After that you want to look at the number of cards which may be dead in some matchups and that you have enough replacements. It's very common in this deck to sideboard a large number of cards in each matchup, since game 1 you have a lot of generic cards and you'll want to also pivot your plan somewhat.

**Making cuts:**

In the base Blue build you'll cut Remand a lot, because it's bad in many matchups. Control, Combo and Tron are the exceptions. Cryptic also gets cut in a number of matchups where they'll be putting pressure on your mana base. In all builds you'll cut all the removal spells in matchups they're dead.

Outside of the interaction suite (which you're just trying to improve for the matchup) you'll also cut some ramp (the Hunting Wilds and a tenth ramp spell if you have one) and it's very common to go down to one Scapeshift. This last means that if they have something which stops you going off you only have one dead card. The exception is matchups where it might get exiled (such as with Thoughtknot Seer) or when you just need to race.

It can also be OK to cut a land on the draw - often a Basic Mountain. You have to be in a matchup where you don't worry about running out of mountains and they're not attacking your mana with cards like Field of Ruin. Matchups with Death's Shadow where you just need to be threat-dense can be good candidates. You can also afford to cut a little more ramp in those cases.

Lastly, if you're playing any of the planeswalkers there are several matchups where they're not great and your sideboard cards are better, particularly vs creature or graveyard decks.

**Graveyard:**

Dredge, Phoenix and Hollow One are all real decks and can be hard to deal with for us. While they're very common we need to have a significant number of cards for them. Sideboard space is tight, but it's not unreasonable to have up to 6 cards in the 75 once you include Anger of the Gods. A combination of the cards below can be good. Post-Modern-Horizons release there are some very fast graveyard decks in the format and having a plan against them is extremely important.

* [Leyline of the Void](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Leyline%20of%20the%20Void) - Leyline is best against the fast graveyard decks like Phoenix and Hogaak and less good against Dredge because of the amount of removal for it they pack. It's also the one you need to play most of and can't be fetched with Bring to Light. Given the format at time of writing though it's probably the best (and necessary) despite the downsides.
* [Rest in Peace](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Rest%20in%20Peace) - The best option if you're playing white since it comes down early enough, but you don't have to start it in your opener. It also can't be fetched with Bring to Light.
* [Ravenous Trap](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Ravenous%20Trap) - Gives you turn-1 interaction and can get a variety of things on the turn you play it. It is a one-shot effect rather than ongoing, but it can be fetched with Bring to Light to reset their graveyard. Hard for the opponent to interact with.
* [Surgical Extraction](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Surgical%20Extraction) - Best in matchups without reduntant pieces. Dredge can survive a surgical, but it's good again Phoenix and reanimator. Less useful to Bring to Light, since it often requires being well timed and doesn't wipe out their whole graveyard.
* [Yixlid Jailer](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Yixlid%20Jailer) - Best against Dredge since you'll often have time to play it and it shuts down a lot of their plan. Doesn't die to as much removal as Leyline or RIP. Can be Brought to Light.
* [Anger of the Gods](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Anger%20of%20the%20Gods) - Anger is a good flexible card as just straight removal, but the exile effect makes it an important card for the graveyard decks as well. Often fetched with Bring to Light.

**Life gain:**

Burn is a tough matchup. Madcap experiment (particularly main) makes it better, but you also need some life gain. There are also other aggro decks where gaining life is important to tide you over until you can win. Most of the cards we run here double up under some of the other categories.

* [Obstinate Baloth](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Obstinate%20Baloth) - The best default choice. A good backup threat which outsizes most aggro cards and 4 life is a decent chunk. Great for getting with Bring to Light. Also very good against Liliana of the Veil. Note that it's not good vs Smallpox, since you discard before you sacrifice, so have to sacrifice the Baloth after putting it into play.
* [Pulse of Murasa](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Pulse%20of%20Murasa) - Can re-buy your other threats including Steve for ramp or just a fetch land if you don't have a land drop in hand. Biggest life swing. 
* [Huntmaster of the Fells](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Huntmaster%20of%20the%20Fells) - Gives you two bodies for matchups where they could answer a Baloth. Very good against control if they can't answer it. Two life isn't so much though. It is easier to cast under a Blood Moon, however.
* [Timely Reinforcements](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Timely%20Reinforcements) - An option for the White versions. Good life swing and also gives you blockers on board. Unlikely to win the game, however.
* [Lone Missionary](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Lone%20Missionary) - If you need early life gain in White this is a good choice which gives you a reasonable blocker for small creatures.
* [Knight of Autumn](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Knight%20of%20Autumn) - A very flexible threat which gives you life gain and removal for two important card types.

**Alternative threats:**

Huntmaster and Baloth from the Lifegain section along with Glen Elendra (see below) are our main alternative threats, along with Madcap Experiment and Hunting Wilds if you're playing them. There are a few others that are worth mentioning.

* [Chameleon Colossus](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Chameleon%20Colossus) - Good when all their removal is Black (such as BGx decks), great if their threats are also Black, such as in Grixis Deaths Shadow. Worth a slot if that's significant in the meta, since it can be a hard matchup otherwise.
* [Vendilion Clique](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Vendilion%20Clique) - Great in many matchups, particularly control, combo and Shadow where it can provide just enough damage and has evasion. In base-Blue bulids I'll usually run two.
* [Tireless Tracker](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Tireless%20Tracker) - Good value creature, particularly in midrange matchups. Doesn't gain life, but can draw a lot of cards if unanswered.

**Silver bullets:**

Bring to Light allows us to run one card in the sideboard and have effectively five copies of in, so we can run one-of silver bullets which are good in specific matchups. I wouldn't play anything I could only cast with Bring to Light though.

* [Shatterstorm](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Shatterstorm) - An automatic include. Great against affinity, Whir and Lantern. The regeneration clause is definitely relevant and you shouldn't play Creeping Corrosion instead.
* [Crumble to Dust](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Crumble%20to%20Dust) - Turns of Tron's mana engine which gives you a lot of extra time and can snag Valakuts against RG builds, but also the mirror. Also worth bringing in for matchups that lean heavily on creature lands like infect, UW control and affinity. 
* [Slaughter Games](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Slaughter%20Games) and [Unmoored Ego](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Unmoored%20Ego) - For the combo matchups. Best against Ad Nauseam, but also good for Living End and Storm.
* [Glen Elendra Archmage](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Glen%20Elendra%20Archmage) - A counterspell which can be preemptively wished for. Listed here because of how great it is against control and combo. All of those matchups find it very hard to win with a Glen in play, since it either turns off their whole plan, or protects the rest of your spells.
* [Madcap Experiment](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Madcap%20Experiment) - Mentioned already, but it's a great silver bullet against Burn and creature matchups which can't answer it. Also stops Ad Naus from winning with Lightning Storm and Storm from winning with Goblins.
* [Back to Nature](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Back%20to%20Nature) - Beats Bogles and also opposing leylines. Can be a card to answer Blood Moons, but I'd probably only run it if Bogles was big in the meta since the more flexible cards can answer single cards like Blood Moon.
* [Collector Ouphe](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Collector%20Ouphe) - This is a Stony Silence effect which can be fetched by Bring to Light. Very good against decks built around Whir of Invention and also both affinity builds, although it's probably not going to win the game by itself. Despite making it fetchable being a creature does come with all the normal downsides, although in a pinch can pressure both the opponent's life total and enemy planeswalkers.

**Removal:**

Some removal has already been mentioned, such as Anger of the Gods, Back to Nature and Shatterstorm. Here are some other options

* [Maelstrom Pulse](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Maelstrom%20Pulse) - A good catchall answer which often has a spot in the sideboard if it's not in the main deck. You need an effect like this somewhere (mostly available if you're in Black). Possibly replaced by Assassin's Trophy, but this will get multiples.
* [Izzet Staticaster](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Izzet%20Staticaster) - Shuts down a number of strategies. Have this as your answer to Empty the Warrens since it's repeatable and they can flash it back. Very good against Elves, Infect and Affinity.
* [Destructive Revelry](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Destructive%20Revelry) - For White builds that don't have so many answers to random permanents this is an answer to Blood Moon which also flexes to artifacts.
* [Ancient Grudge](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Ancient%20Grudge) - If affinity is big and you need more removal spells this gives you two shots. It's also harder to deal with for Lantern since they can't just mill it.
* [Rending Volley](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Rending%20Volley) - An option if the restricted colours and uncounterability is useful.
* [Force of Vigor](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Force%20of%20Vigor) - Four mana is a lot, but if you can get both modes off well worth pitching another card. On balance it's a good upgrade to Destructive Revelry, particularly in white builds which don't have 'destroy target permanent' effects. Gets you out from under Blood Moon, but notably not out from under Karn/Lattice locks, since Lattice makes all cards colourless you have nothing you can exile to it.
* [Plague Engineer](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Plague%20Engineer) - As with Collector Ouphe, being a creature makes it somewhat better than Engineered Plague. A comparison can be made with Izzet Staticaster compared to which it has some pros and some cons. The permanent, non-targetted, size reduction beats protection and hexproof effects and is a relevant reduction in clock even when it doesn't kill things. On the other hand, you have to commit to a single creature type, which outside of tribal decks means it won't get everything.

**Counter magic:**

It's usually right to have some other more specific counterspells in the board. Usually these aren't for creatures, but interacting with combo decks and protecting your own spells against control. Usually you'll play a total of 3-4 in the board.

* [Dispel](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Dispel) - One of the cheapest options and makes it possible to have multiple protective counterspells on your critical turn. Good against counterspells and some combo cards (Ad Nauseam, Chord of Calling), but doesn't get all of them and doesn't get non-creature permanents.
* [Negate](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Negate) - One of the most flexible options for counterspells. There's a lot of planeswalkers at the moment which is a strong reason to want a full negate effect. A good default if you're not sure which to play.
* [Dovin's Veto](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Dovin's%20Veto) - Strict upgrade on Negate if you're playing white. Note that it's not very good at defending your own combo since a second counter can just go to your original spell. Great against other people's proactive spells though. The white in the cost is not free, particularly if you're trying to cast Bring to Light on the same turn, so may be mixed with Negate.
* [Force of Negation](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Force%20of%20Negation) - Probably only playable in the main-blue builds because you need a good number of blue cards to use the pitch cost. Remember that you can only pitch on your opponent's turn, but the face cost of 1UU is quite easy to have available alongside either Scapeshift or Bring to Light given we're trying to have 7 or 8 lands to combo anyway. Where you do have the blue count it's probably right to play this over Negate in the board, but it is harder to have multiple counterspells alongside a threat.
* [Narset's Reversal](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Narset's%20Reversal) - This is very marginal as an include with the main reason for it being as a way to counter Dovin's Veto. You cast it to bounce and copy your own Scapeshift and Veto won't resolve. The copy of the Scapeshift will win if they don't have another counter spell and if they do, you still have another one for next turn. Using it on Bring to Light won't work, however, since the copy wasn't cast, your converge will be for zero.
* [Flusterstorm](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Flusterstorm) - Flusterstorm is a lot worse in Modern than earlier formats since the format is a lot more based around permanents than instants and sorceries. As a result, Negate effects are generally better. Being only one mana is relevant though and it's extremely good at winning conuterspell wars. I'd probably only include it if you're concerned about specifically storm with some benefits in counter matchups.

## Matchup guides and sideboarding

These guides list some sample sideboard cards and cuts. You may have a slightly different selection of them, so this is just a sample.

**Phoenix**

Arclight Phoenix is on the down, but is still quite common. It's capable of some very fast starts, which can be hard to beat. If you can stave off their fast starts then you have a reasonable game against them since you can answer most of their slow threats very well. Not dieing on turn 3 is the priority, but once you've managed that you want to setup for your own combo win. Watch out for Blood Moon post-board.

*In:* All your graveyard hate

**Hogaak Bridgevine**

This deck is extremely scary and can win on early turns in multiple ways. It can cast an 8/8 on turn two, but also with Altar of Dementia and finding bridges can repeatedly cast and sacrifice Hogaak to mill you out. Do not underestimate this deck. You need to have interaction on the first two turns to beat this and their fast draws require Leyline of the Void to beat. It's likely to be banned at some point, but until then needs to be respected. Remember the second trigger on Bridge from Below, you can sandbag activating Sakura-Tribe Elder to exile them. If you do it in response to the other trigger they will not get zombies. They will be bringing in Wispmare to answer your Leylines.

*In:* All your graveyard hate. Might be worth having Collector Ouphe as well to turn off Altar.

**Burn**
Burn is the primary reason to have main-deck Platinum Emperion. At GP Birmingham I lost my last two rounds to Burn. Both games followed the same pattern: Game 1 I kept blind and missed on an early Madcap or BTL and remands weren't enough to save me. Game 2 they scooped to a turn 4 Emperion. Game 3 they kept a 7 with path / destructive revelry and enough burn to kill me on turn 4 or 5 after removing it, since they were on the play. Without the Emperion your game one is very hard against Burn and post-board they do have draws to beat it, so relying on winning both post-board games is hard.

With Emperion you get a lot of free game 1s and then they have to beat it in both of the game 2s. You do also have life-gain plans post board, but Skullcrack is omnipresent and sometimes so is Atarka's Command. I've lost games to them Cracking my Baloth as well. I will generally go for Madcap over Baloth if they've not seen it yet, or if they have mana up. It can be right if they're tapped out to make Baloth since you know the life gain will resolve, particularly if they have creatures in play.

Most burn players these days are not sideboarding Blood Moon, but you need to at least consider it.

*In:* Obstinate Baloth, Glen Elendra Archmage, Negate, Dispel, Pulse of Murasa, Maelstrom Pulse, Knight of Autumn

This matchup is all about early interaction and racing to Madcap or BTL. Remand is terrible against them and Cryptic is hard to cast when you're prioritizing basics over shocks and want to make GG for Baloths. 

**UWx Control**

You're the combo deck and they are the control deck. Game 1 you just want to try and setup your game plan and try and force it through any counterspell that they have. Game 2 you can bring in some alternative threats along with more counterspells, and cut your useless removal. Glen Elendra is the MVP post-board and Huntmaster can steal games if they can't answer it immediately. You need to win before the late game or the UW player will bury you in card advantage. One of the most important aspects for us to leverage is a mana advantage. Being able to pay for more counterspells on the combo turn is how you win. Teferi and Narset are both excellent in this matchup.

*In:* Glen Elendra Archmage, Vendilion Clique, Huntmaster of the Fells, Tireless Tracker, Negate, Dispel, Crumble to Dust, Force of Negation, Flusterstorm

Bring in the creatures which interact with them and counterspells. Crumble is marginal, but taking our their Collonades can reduce their number of win conditions significantly and you will usually have enough cuts.

**Titan Shift**

They have a more reliable clock, but you have counterspells. It's a generally favourable matchup because of that. It is a matchup where you need to be very familiar with the lines in their deck so you know when you can tap out for your own ramp spells and when you need to hold up counterspells. It can be possible to buy yourself a turn by staying above 18, but shocking to have cryptic up is usually more important. In the long game they can win just by making natural Valakut and land drops, so your plan it to beat their quick combos with counterspells and then scapeshift yourself.

Post board you have even more ways to interact with them.

*In:* Vendilion Clique, Glen Elendra Archmage, Slaughter Games, Negate, Dispel, Maelstrom Pulse, Crumble to Dust, Force of Negation

The Crumble is to go after Valakut if they have exactly 1 in play. What you name with Slaughter Games depends on the board state and what you think you can beat. Scapeshift is the thing that beats you on the spot so is the default thing to take.

**Eldrazi Tron**

Eldrazi Tron is a midrange creature deck with limited interaction. This makes it relatively favourable. Remand is usually very live since most lists at the moment only play a single cavern and it will buy their whole turn 3 tapping out for Thought-Knot Seer. TKS is their main form of interaction, so you may find yourself having to top-deck a win condition. Platinum Emperion will buy you a lot of turns since Karn is their only out and they normally only run two. Sultai charm is a lot worse, but they do sometimes have chalices you want to get rid of. With War of the Spark they can also play Karn the Great Creator giving them more ways to interact.

*In:* Obstinate Baloth, Chameleon Colossus, Vendilion Clique, Maelstrom Pulse

A trick to watch out for: if you have to discard to Reality Smasher then discarding Baloth will trigger the put into play clause, since they control the ability of Smasher. Also don't forget that post-board they can have counterspells for your Bring to Light and Scapeshift.

**Humans**

Humans is an aggro deck backed up by disruptive creatures. They can have a very quick clock and the creatures can quickly get out of range of your Red removal. Counterspells are also bad because of the Cavern of Souls and Aether Vial, although Cryptic tapping their creatures down or bouncing their creatures is very good.

Removal is how you win the matchup, it's primarily about trying to be the control deck. You can't do it for too long, however, as they have a lot of threats, and several of them have haste. Having a diversity of removal is useful because they play Meddling Mage and you often need them to guess wrong.

Madcap experiment can hold them off for a while, although they have Reflector Mage to bounce it.

*In:* Anger of the Gods, Obstinate Baloth, Huntmaster of the Fells, Maelstrom Pulse, Plague Engineer

Your ground creatures can help to stabilize and any extra hard removal is good. Izzet Staticaster isn't, however, since most things will be bigger than 1 toughness. Despite that, Plague Engineer is good, since it's a permanent effect and reduces power.

**Spirits**

Spirits is also an aggro deck backed up by disruptive creatures, but they interact more on the stack. Again removal is good, but you should focus most on sweepers, since they have several ways to give things hexproof. Their best card against you is Spell Queller. Often a removal spell afterwards can answer it, but take care that lots of their cards have 3 CMC so you may need to be careful to make sure that Fatal Push is online.

They are more of a tempo deck than pure aggro, so they'll be trying to stop your interactive spells and win conditions. You need to be able to answer that when you go for big spells. They can also have counterspells out of the board. They also have both Cavern of Souls and Aether Vial to play around counterspells. Out of the board, Worship is a common card you need to be able to beat to win. Doing so by removing all their creatures can be hard given flash creatures, Aether Vial and Moorland Haunt.

*In:* Anger of the Gods, Vendilion Clique, Glen Elendra Archmage, Maelstrom Pulse, Plague Engineer

All of their creatures are evasive, so the big ground dorks aren't useful, but all your fliers are.

**Ad Nauseam**

Ad Nauseam is a hard matchup. This is not to say necessarily a bad matchup, but it's very difficult to play. You're playing counterspells which they need to play around. On the other side, they have Angel's Grace, so tapping out to try and Scapeshift them is also risky. Madcap is good in this matchup since it turns off their main win condition. They will still have Laboratory Maniac to win with, but it buys you a couple of turns since they need extra mana and can often be awkward to execute. It also provides you a repeatable clock to beat with forcing them to use Angel's Graces. Main deck you also have a lot of dead cards.

*In:* Slaughter Games, Glen Elendra Archmage, Negate, Dispel, Maelstrom Pulse, Vendilion Clique, Flusterstorm, Force of Negation

Don't keep in answers to Lab Man, since if they get that far they have probably drawn their whole deck and have multiple pacts of negation to answer removal spells. The one thing to consider is that they probably have a Dromoka or a Sigarda to board in which can steal games if cast early. 

Slaughter Games will usually name Ad Nauseam unless you have a specific reason not to. The Vendilion Cliques gives you an early piece of disruption which can give you a clock while you hold up counterspells for their combo. Glen does the same while also providing counterspells that their Pacts of Negation don't answer and is possibly the best card in the matchup. Remember that they're able to win on your turn which can make Force of Negation potentially awkward. Narset doesn't help much here (they don't actually draw the cards). Teferi can help as it prevents them doing upkeep shenanigans, counters suspend cards and stops them responding to your counterspells. 

The Scapeshift win against this deck is so risky that unless you're playing with discard to clear the way, or Teferi to turn off Angel's Grace in response, it can be right to cut all the Scapeshifts and one or two Bring to Lights, relying on making creatures and holding up interaction.

**Storm**

Storm plays similar to Ad Nauseam. Their answers to your combo are remand, which you can at least respond to, and your removal spells are not dead main deck since killing their creatures is crucial. Your Madcap answers Empty the Warrens if they try and win via that route. It's another deck that you have to be careful tapping out against, since they can win on the spot if they untap with a creature in play and sometimes with nothing in play if they have 4 or even 3 lands available.

*In:* Glen Elendra Archmage, Vendilion Clique, Negate, Dispel, Slaughter Games, Izzet Staticaster, Leyline of the Void, Ravenous Trap, Rest in Peace, Force of Negation, Flusterstorm, Plague Engineer

You need to leave in some point removal for their creatures. Madcap answers Empty the Warrens, as do Izzet Staticaster / Plague Engineer, which is the sweeper of choice since it also kills them the second time they cast everything. Slaughter games will often go after Grapeshot since we have answers to Empty, but Gifts Ungiven is also a very reasonable target since it's hard for them to win without it. This is another matchup where Glen is MVP. You'll normally want to counter Gifts or Past in Flames, but do be aware that they can have a natural Empty the Warrens. The graveyard interaction also counters their Gifts and Past in Flames lines, which is how they normally win.

**Gx Tron**

Against us Tron is very much a combo deck. An early Karn is beatable but hard. Ulamog is almost always game over. To counteract that they have very little way to interact outside of that and all our counterspells are live. Remand is very good here because it will usually buy their whole turn. Game 1 is very dependent on the dice roll and their draw. If they make Tron on turn 3 on the play with a threat they're heavily favoured. If we can get a couple of ramp spells down and hold up counterspells before they make Tron it's a lot better. The addition of Assassin's Trophy makes keeping them off Tron even pre-board very real.

Many Tron decks are now playing Karn the Great Creator. Be careful of the Mycosynth Lattice lockout, but they can also do damage with Liquimetal Coating which combines with Karn's +1 to kill your lands. 

*In:* Crumble to Dust, Maelstrom Pulse, Slaughter Games, Glen Elendra Archmage, Negate, Vendilion Clique, Force of Negation, Collector Ouphe

Your main plan post board is to get an early Crumble to take them off making Tron. They can still make land drops and play natural 6 and 7 drops, but it gives you a lot of time. Draw-step Cliques can keep them off threats. Slaughter Games could name several things and is mostly there because the other cards are worse. Karn or Ulamog are most likely. You can afford to cut some of your removal that does work against them because Wurmcoils don't stop you winning and Ulamog is indestructible anyway. You keep bolts to kill a Karn that's gone -3.

They will bring in Thragtusk so watch their life total but also Warping Wail which can get both Scapeshift and Crumble to Dust.

**Affinity**

Pre-board this matchup is die-roll dependent and depends on our draw. Remand is terrible against them and cryptic often slow or they can play around it with creatur lands. An early Damnation is probably the best way to win, but can still lose to a Cranial Plating-heavy draw. As with any deck against Affinity killing Overseers on sight is required and we have many ways to do that. You also have Sultai Charm as a main-deck answer to plating.

Platinum Emperion is only OK against Affinity. They can still kill you with infect and they can also gain enough life with a plating on a Vault Skirge to put your Scapeshift out of reach while also presenting a blocker to trade with the Emperion. It's better against the Hardened Scales version. 

*In:* Anger of the Gods, Maelstrom Pulse, Shattershorm, Izzet Staticaster, Glen Elendra Archmage, Vendilion Clique, Crumble to Dust, Negate, Obstinate Baloth, Collector Ouphe, Force of Vigor

This is the matchup most likely to board into Blood Moon. This is very beatable as long as you fetch lands appropriately. If you do then it will typically screw them more by turning off all their creature lands. It is why we board in all the creatures to have an alternative way to win. You do have Sultai Charm and Maelstrom Pulse to destroy moon if you can then win with scapeshift but often it will be better to leave them under the Blood Moon and win via an alternative route.

The flyers give you the ability to trade with their creatures and if you can stop them getting an active Master or Overseer Staticaster kills almost everything. Shatterstorm is obviously the MVP and you should try and turn-4 one as often as possible. They will sometimes have Welding Jars so it's important to be Shatterstorm and not Creeping Corrosion. They can still come back from that, so it's not a panacea. The most contraversial include is probably Crumble to Dust. I think taking away one of their two creature lands is potentially worthwhile, particularly if it's the one that can beat Platinum Emperion. Depending on your meta you may consider cutting Shatterstorm despite the advantages and rely on Force of Vigor plus Collector Ouphe.

**R/G/W Land Destruction / Ponza**

The main-deck blood moon and land destruction deck would seem to be good against us. However, it's a surprisingly winnable matchup, particularly if they don't know the matchup. You have Sultai Charm as a main-deck answer to Blood Moon and Madcap Experiment as an alternative win condition if all your lands are mountains. Fetching basics is very important pre and post-board to make sure that you can cast spells still but if you do, you should be in good shape. They have no hand disruption or counter spells so if you can get enough lands in play you're favoured.

Sideboarding depends on exactly their plan, in particular if they're playing Nahiri. A good rule of thumb is:

*In:* All of your creatures, Negate, Maelstrom Pulse, Pulse of Murasa, Force of Negation, Force of Vigor

You're giving up on getting triple-blue in play against these decks and Scapeshift is very much the backup plan. They will probably go all-in in keeping you off Scapeshift, so get Forest Forest Island Swamp in play and just cast your other threats. Hunting Wilds is a very relevant alternate win condition under Blood Moon.

**Grixis Shadow**

Main deck they have draws which are very hard for us to beat. Triple-discard, or T1 discard into T2 angler are tricky starts for most people. We do have live removal and most games you will have live draws for answers. Steve is also good at buying time in this matchup, since they will often be attacking with a single creature.

Games in this matchup can often go quite long and rely heavily on your top-decks. For sideboarding I want to maximize my live draws and hitting ramp early is less important. It's also a matchup where you don't need all 11 mountains, since the shadow player will have done most of the work for you. They do have answers to Platinum Emperion though.

*In:* Obstinate Baloth, Chameleon Colossus, Maelstrom Pulse, Vendilion Clique, Dispel, Negate, Glen Elendra Archmage, Pulse of Murasa

The best card in the matchup and the one you should tutor for if you get the opportunity is Chameleon Colossus. Cliques you can end-step when they're on low life to finish them off and Pulse of Murasa allows you to rebuy something that's been discarded. The reason for the asymmetry of the cuts is that while STEve is better because it can block, their turn 1 discard will often take ramp spells. Search can get under that, but only on the play.

Force of Negation is a worse include here since their threats are creatures and you want the negates on your own turn.

**Others**

For most decks you play against you can tune your deck post-board to answer their game plan or protect yours. In many matchups your post-board games will be won with creatures rather than Scapeshift. Here are some quick notes:

*Hate bears:* Removal is king. Leonin Arbiter and Mindcensor are their best carhs and must-answers. I cut a Bring to Light because of that. They will often also board in Canonist or Eidolon of Rhetoric as well.

*Merfolk:* Board in sweepers and answers to counterspells. It is a tribal deck, but Plague engineer will mostly just counter a Lord effect. Most of their cards are base 2 toughness anyway.

*Company Combo:* The adage 'bolt the bird' is wrong in this matchup. Save removal for counterspells or sweepers for a board after they've used up their cards. Infinite life beats you even with a Platinum Emperion in play.

*Bogles:* Our removal is mostly dead. I'd consider a Back to Nature in the board if you expect this

*Mono-blue Tron:* It's a counterspell matchup first and foremost. Post board you have Crumble to make theirs all bad. Watch out for their fun-of artifacts they can loop. You can lose to mindslaver or jesters cap. Collector Ouphe is good since they have win conditions in artifact activated abilities.

*Gx Midrange:* Discard is their only options to beat you. Bring in the Baloths for Liliana and Chameleon Colossus which can't be killed by Jund. Anger is good against Junk and Pulse of Murasa rebuys creature threats. Cut Madcap, they have lots of removal.

*Lantern Control/Whir Prison:* This is a relatively good matchup. Bridge doesn't stop your combo. Shatterstorm is MVP and Pulse of Murasa can rebuy things which were milled. Do bring in creatures since you can answer bridge and you want to maximise threats. Collector Ouphe is great as well, although mostly against Lantern rather than Prison.

*Elves:* Kill everything, board in all your sweepers. They can have quick draws, but they have few or no main-deck answers to Madcap. You can probably steal one game with that before they board in answers. Definitely the best matchup for Plague Engineer, but it's a great matchup for you anyway

*Dredge:* Bring in all your graveyard hate. Be aware that they will have many answers to Leyline of the Void, so the others can be better.

*Living End:* Counterspells are excellent, particularly remand. We're the control in this matchup. Their only interaction is Fulminators. Slaughter Games for Living End is GG.

*Goryo's Vengence:* You're leaning on your counterspells, but a T2 or T3 combo on the play will kill you. Pulse of Murasa can give them back the card they're targetting with Vengence.
