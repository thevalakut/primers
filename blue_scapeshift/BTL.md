# Bring to Light Scapeshift Primer

Bring to Light is a 4-colour combo-control deck centered around the ability to tutor up the best card for the moment with Bring to Light. It is a deck full of interaction that you can tailor for the particular matchup and metagame. You specifically want to be able to get Scapeshift to have a combo kill which you can use as early as turn 4. This commits you to running 4 colours. Blue and Green are required by Bring to Light and Red is implied by the number of mountains required for the Scapeshift kill.

## Variants

There are three principle variants. Two decks where Blue/Green are the primary colours and one which is base Black/Green/Red and Blue is the splash.

The base-Blue decks are centered around counter spells, particularly Cryptic Command and Remand. The splash colours enable Bring to Light with four colours and control cards, usually removal.

The base-Black deck is centered around discard and board control rather than counter spells.

The choice between Black and White as the splash is largely determined by which sideboard cards you want to play and which main-deck removal spells are good in the current meta.

The base-Black deck is best in metas where counter spells, particularly Remand, are bad. Discard gives you earlier interaction for faster formats and having more black lands and less reliance on having triple-Blue for Cryptic allows you to cast black removal earlier as well.

## The Core

The core of the deck is the ramp, mana base and win conditions.

Ramp:

* 4 Search for Tomorrow
* 4 Sakura-Tribe Elder
* 1 two-land ramp spell (usually either Hunting Wilds or Kodama's Reach)

Win conditions:

* 4 Bring to Light
* 2 Scapeshift

Mana base:

* 2 Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle
* 4 Stomping Ground
* 4 Green-x fetches (Misty Rainforest or Verdant Catacombs)
* 4 Red-x Shocklands (Steam Vents or Blood Crypts)
* 1 Breeding Pool
* 1 Watery Grave
* 1 Overgrown Tomb
* 8 Basic lands (including 2 Mountains, 2 Forest, 1 Island, 1 Swamp)
* 1 flex slot (Overgrown Tomb, Cinder Glade, Flooded Grove, Blood Crypt)

Variant-specific land notes are below, but one comment on the basic Mountains here. Since the printing of Field of Ruin and Assassin's Trophy there's a higher number of land destruction cards which replace with a land. We need to be able to get a basic after Scapeshift if they destroy a Mountain in response to the triggers to avoid the triggers fizzling, so we run two to ensure we always have one to get.

This is 41 cards, leaving 19 cards specific to the different types.

## Base-Blue variants

Mana base:

For Blue builds the mana base options are Misty Rainforest, Steam Vents and 3 Islands, 2 Mountains, 2 Forest and 1 Swamp. The flex slot can be any of the listed options depending on how many Mountains you want and how many Black sources, which will depend on the rest of your deck choices. You need at least 10 Mountains in the deck, but I recommend 11 if you can at all manage it. There can be situations that you run the risk of running out.

Counter spells:

In the main deck we typically play 3 Cryptic Commands and 3 Remands and a flex slot or two. Options for other counterspells include:

* Izzet Charm - Flexible counter spell, removal and card selection.
* Ojutai's Command - Provides life gain and combos with both Sakura-Tribe Elder and Snapcaster Mage, cantripping like Cryptic Command while having a significantly easier casting cost. Main-deck help for the burn matchup.

For further options see Sideboard cards below. 

Removal:

Typically the deck will play at least one sweeper, usually a four mana hard wrath, plus either 0 or 1 Anger of the Gods and a number of point removal spells.

The wrath is typically either:

* Damnation if playing Black.
* Supreme Verdict if playing White.

Both uncounterability and the regeneration clause are relevent in the format. White gets to choose and can run Wrath of God instead, but usually uncounterability is the choice if it's available.

Anger of the Gods is main deck when graveyard strategies are good or go-wide aggro strategies where you need to wrath earlier and often. If not, you can forego the maindeck copy and just bring one in from the side.

Removal options include:

* Lightning Bolt - A generic catch-all which also can be removal for Planeswalkers and can reduce the opponent's life total below 18 for matchups which don't take pain from their mana base.
* Fatal Push - One of the reasons to play black. Deals with many high-toughness threats for only one mana, such as Tarmogoyf and Death's Shadow. Care should be taken when you need to kill three and four CMC threats, since your only ways to enable revolt are 4 fetch lands and Sakura-Tribe Elder.
* Abrupt Decay - Flexible removal for any permanent type and the uncounterability is relevant. Creature lands and some 4-CMC threats (such as Thought-Knot Seer) are a reason that Fatal Push can still be better. Kills Blood Moon.
* Assassin's Trophy - Hard removal for permanents of all types, toughness and mana costs. The downside of getting a land is definitely real, but we're not trying to go long, often just needing to stall long enough to get to our win condition. Kills Blood Moon and interacts with Tron lands.
* Path to Exile - If Path to Exile is good then this is one of the draws of playing the white splash. It will answer any creature of any size or mana cost.

The above can often be present in multiples. There are also some other options which are usually only found as one-ofs:

* Terminate - A good option if you want a hard removal spell for things you can't Push or Decay. Somewhat replaced by Assassin's Trophy, but doesn't have the downside and does have the no-regen clause.
* Sultai Charm - Another main-deckable option for destroying Blood Moon, Leyline of Sanctity or other permanent-based hate. The mono-coloured restriction is not a free-roll with Humans, Spirits and Eldrazi in the format, but it usually has targets even in those matchups. The backup mode is very good though, you don't go down a card like you do with Izzet Charm.
* Maelstrom Pulse - Another catch-all card which can answer Blood Moon. Mostly eclipsed by either Sultai Charm or Assassin's Trophy, but the ability to catch things in multiples can be useful.

Most of these options are black, except for Path to Exile and if you want to lean more on removal then having black as your splash is recommended. If you think that Lightning Bolt is good in the metagame then it is possible to play with just Bolt and a sweeper as your removal spell, which allows you to pick either splash. The early 2019 metagame, however, has a lot of Humans, Spirits and Eldrazi decks which require you to lean more towards removal and which bolt is not always good, so it's likely that black with Push and some of the hard removal options are probably the best.

Win conditions:

While our main plan is to win with Scapeshift, it is important to have a secondary win condition. If that win condition can be fetched with Bring to Light then one card can be five ways to play it. Your choice of other win conditions also affects the number of Scapeshifts that you play. Generally you should play either two or three. It is possible to just play a fourth Cryptic Command over the third Scapeshift, but usually you want to play a win condition in that slot.

* Madcap Experiment - This one-card combo with Platinum Emperion can be fetched by Bring to Light as early as turn three. It's excellent against burn (one of the few ways to have a good pre-board matchup against them) and Elves (which is a free win game one). It's also very good against the other creature and tribal decks, although they will often have some way to remove it, so you may have a choice of whether to fetch this or your sweeper if you're casting Bring to Light. Other matchups it can be a road bump (storm needs +8 and can't win with goblins, ad naus can't win with Lightning Storm) and removing it with Path does accelerate you to Scapeshift. The downside of Madcap is poor hands when you draw the Platinum Emperion, slightly increasing the number of hands you'll need to mulligan. It is possible to hard cast, however, so drawing it isn't terminal.
* Jace, the Mind Sculptor - Jace is in the abstract a very good card and is also very castable in this deck. You can't get it with Bring to Light, but it is very good at digging you to win conditions. If you can untap with Jace you can usually get a lot of value from it, however there are many matchups in modern where tapping out for a 4-drop which doesn't affect the board match is not good.
* Hunting Wilds vs Kodama's Reach - There's always one of these two in the deck, but there are pros and cons for both. Hunting Wilds has the advantage of being a genuine win condition in its own right, working under a Blood Moon and sometimes just naturally triggering Valakuts. It also puts two lands straight into play. The argument for Kodama's Reach is that you can Bring it to Light with only three colours. While you only get one into play (and it can only get basics), it is often the case that by land 7 you don't have another land to play from hand anyway, which means it's not a downside, and can even be an upside, since the second one can come into play untapped.

These are the alternative win conditions played in the main deck. There will always be several more creatures available to bring in post board to try and play around hate for your main plan, as well as for their disruptive utility. For more on those, see Sideboard cards.

Utility:

* Snapcaster Mage - Snapcaster Mage is great at rebuying ramp, counters, removal and early Bring to Lights which got board control into being win conditions. It combos particularly well with Cryptic Command and there should always be at least one in the deck. Two is very reasonable although you don't normally go above that.
* Worldly Counsel - This is usually Impulse and almost always at least Anticipate. The ability to get any type is important as you're often looking for lands as much as spells. For pure ability to dig this is probably the best option and in the standard Blue builds I'd probably recommend one or two.
* Search for Azcanta - In theory Search is great. Filtering early and late it ramps you and digs for win conditions. It can be a little slow to get online, however. When you're using counterspells you're typically filling your graveyard a little slower, particularly with only four fetches. I wouldn't play more than one in the base Blue builds. In the discard-focussed list it's a bit better, since you're both filling your graveyard faster and slowing down the opponent's plan to allow it time to get online.
* Farseek - You often want a tenth ramp spell and this is the default with no other considerations. It fetches all of your duals, particularly if you're playing the one you can't fetch with your fetch lands (eg Blood Crypt with Mistys).
* Prismatic Omen - Prismatic Omen can be a bit like a ramp spell, with some upside. It doesn't get you to an early Bring to Light quicker, which is a big downside, given the speed of the format, particularly post board when you want to hit your silver bullets. However, it allows you to scapeshift off 6 lands, fixes for Cryptic Command, even under a Blood Moon (it goes on timestamps) and can give you some higher damage lines if your opponent is on a high life total or you're short on mountains. Probably best in a three-Scapeshift, no one-ofs build.
* Growth Spiral - The newest entrant here. A good card in an unknown meta, not great but not terrible against anything. It allows you to hold up remand on turn 2 without foregoing ramp, but does require you to have the extra land already to put into play. Good with Snapcaster Mage, but likely to always be your first cut when sideboarding. You're unlikely to play more than Two.

## Base-Black variants

Mana base:

For Black builds the mana base options are Verdant Catacombs, Blood Crypt and 1 Island, 2 Mountains, 3 Forest and 2 Swamps. The flex slot is either Steam Vents or Overgrown Tomb depending on the number of Mountains you want (see above) and Green/Black sources. Without Cryptic the mana costs are a little easier to cast, so we only need 3 U/B sources not 4.
