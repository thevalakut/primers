# Bring to Light Scapeshift Primer

Bring to Light is a 4-colour combo-control deck centered around the ability to tutor up the best card for the moment with Bring to Light. It is a deck full of interaction that you can tailor for the particular matchup and metagame. You specifically want to be able to get Scapeshift to have a combo kill which you can use as early as turn 4. This commits you to running 4 colours. Blue and Green are required by Bring to Light and Red is implied by the number of mountains required for the Scapeshift kill.

## Variants

There are three principle variants. Two decks where Blue/Green are the primary colours and one which is base Black/Green/Red and Blue is the splash.

The base-Blue decks are centered around counter spells, particularly Cryptic Command and Remand. The splash colours enable Bring to Light with four colours and control cards, usually removal.

The base-Black deck is centered around discard and board control rather than counter spells.

The choice between Black and White as the splash is largely determined by which sideboard cards you want to play and which main-deck removal spells are good in the current meta.

The base-Black deck is best in metas where counter spells, particularly Remand, are bad. Discard gives you earlier interaction for faster formats and having more black lands and less reliance on having triple-Blue for Cryptic allows you to cast black removal earlier as well.

## The Core

The core of the deck is the ramp, mana base and win conditions.

Ramp:

* 4 Search for Tomorrow
* 4 Sakura-Tribe Elder
* 1 two-land ramp spell (usually either Hunting Wilds or Kodama's Reach)

Win conditions:

* 4 Bring to Light
* 2 Scapeshift

Mana base:

* 2 Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle
* 4 Stomping Ground
* 4 Green-x fetches (Misty Rainforest or Verdant Catacombs)
* 4 Red-x Shocklands (Steam Vents or Blood Crypts)
* 1 Breeding Pool
* 1 Watery Grave
* 1 Overgrown Tomb
* 8 Basic lands (including 2 Mountains, 2 Forest, 1 Island, 1 Swamp)
* 1 flex slot (Overgrown Tomb, Cinder Glade, Flooded Grove, Blood Crypt)

This is 41 cards, leaving 19 cards specific to the different types.

## Base-Blue variants

Mana base:

For Blue builds the mana base options are Misty Rainforest, Steam Vents and 3 Islands, 2 Mountains, 2 Forest and 1 Swamp. The flex slot can be any of the listed options depending on how many Mountains you want and how many Black sources, which will depend on the rest of your deck choices. You need at least 10 Mountains in the deck, but I recommend 11 if you can at all manage it. There can be situations that you run the risk of running out.

Counter spells:

In the main deck we typically play 3 Cryptic Commands and 3 Remands and a flex slot or two. Options for other counterspells include:

* Izzet Charm - Flexible counter spell, removal and card selection.
* Ojutai's Command - Provides life gain and combos with both Sakura-Tribe Elder and Snapcaster Mage, cantripping like Cryptic Command while having a significantly easier casting cost. Main-deck help for the burn matchup.
* TODO (any others here)

For further options see Sideboard cards below. 

Removal:

Typically the deck will play at least one sweeper, usually a four mana hard wrath, plus either 0 or 1 Anger of the Gods and a number of point removal spells.

The wrath is typically either:

* Damnation if playing Black.
* Supreme Verdict if playing White.

Both uncounterability and the regeneration clause are relevent in the format. White gets to choose and can run Wrath of God instead, but usually uncounterability is the choice if it's available.

Anger of the Gods is main deck when graveyard strategies are good or go-wide aggro strategies where you need to wrath earlier and often. If not, you can forego the maindeck copy and just bring one in from the side.

Removal options include:

* Lightning Bolt - A generic catch-all which also can be removal for Planeswalkers and can reduce the opponent's life total below 18 for matchups which don't take pain from their mana base.
* Fatal Push - One of the reasons to play black. Deals with many high-toughness threats for only one mana, such as Tarmogoyf and Death's Shadow. Care should be taken when you need to kill three and four CMC threats, since your only ways to enable revolt are 4 fetch lands and Sakura-Tribe Elder.
* Abrupt Decay - Flexible removal for any permanent type and the uncounterability is relevant. Creature lands and some 4-CMC threats (such as Thought-Knot Seer) are a reason that Fatal Push can still be better. Kills Blood Moon.
* Assassin's Trophy - Hard removal for permanents of all types, toughness and mana costs. The downside of getting a land is definitely real, but we're not trying to go long, often just needing to stall long enough to get to our win condition. Kills Blood Moon and interacts with Tron lands.
* Path to Exile - If Path to Exile is good then this is one of the draws of playing the white splash. It will answer any creature of any size or mana cost.

The above can often be present in multiples. There are also some other options which are usually only found as one-ofs:

* Terminate - A good option if you want a hard removal spell for things you can't Push or Decay. Somewhat replaced by Assassin's Trophy, but doesn't have the downside and does have the no-regen clause.
* Sultai Charm - Another main-deckable option for destroying Blood Moon, Leyline of Sanctity or other permanent-based hate. The mono-coloured restriction is not a free-roll with Humans, Spirits and Eldrazi in the format, but it usually has targets even in those matchups. The backup mode is very good though, you don't go down a card like you do with Izzet Charm.
* Maelstrom Pulse
* TODO: anything else here?

Win conditions:

* Madcap Experiment
* Jace, the Mind Sculptor
* Hunting Wilds vs Kodama's Reach

These are the alternative win conditions played in the main deck. There will always be several more creatures available to bring in post board to try and play around hate for your main plan, as well as for their disruptive utility. For more on those, see Sideboard cards.
